Research interests
==================

I am a French graduate student in History and Philosophy of Science (Université de Paris), with a training in Physics (at the École Normale Supérieure de Cachan and Université Pierre et Marie Curie).
I am interested in epistemology, history and sociology of science, cultural evolution, innovation, and of course physics (cosmology, particle physics, gravitational astronomy and more).
I also like programming (mostly in python for the past few years) and statistics.

Current projects
================

Dynamics of a research program in high-energy physics (master's thesis)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Supersymmetry (SUSY) in particle physics is a theory that predicts a symmetry between bosons and fermions, such that for each boson of the standard model, there exists a fermionic symmetric superpartner, and vice-versa.
Since it was first proposed in the 70s, SUSY has been the focus of a lot of attention from the high-energy physics community, and thousands of physicists have been involved in this research program. Yet, the search for SUSY at the LHC and in other experiments has been unfruitful so far.
What is the rationale for pursuing this program, despite empiric evidence? What are the forces that shape and drive a research program in particle physics, beyond experimental constraints?
My goal is to analyze the literature and social networks of scientists by using quantitative methods such as NLP, network science, statistical modeling, in order to better address these questions.

  
Language Acquisition Across Cultures
------------------------------------

I am also an engineer at the <a href="https://lscp.dec.ens.fr/en">LSCP</a>, as part of the Language Acquisition Across Cultures team led by Alejandrina Cristia. 
We study Language Acquisition by collecting and analyzing long-form recordings capturing the sound environment of infants (what they ear) and their own vocal production.
This method generates large amounts of audio (typically thousands of hours of audio per corpus) which can be challenging to analyze.
My work consists into developing <a href="https://github.com/LAAC-LSCP/ChildProject">tools</a> that enable performant systematic analyses across such corpora.
