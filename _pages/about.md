Research interests
==================

I am a French student starting a PhD in Philosophy of physics at the Interdisciplinary Centre for Science and Technology Studies in Wuppertal. I have a training in Physics (École Normale Supérieure de Cachan and Université Pierre et Marie Curie) and in History and Philosophy of Science (Université Paris-Cité).

I am interested in epistemology, philosophy and sociology of science, cultural evolution, innovation, and of course physics (cosmology, particle physics, gravitational astronomy and more).

Currently, I do lots of statistics, in particular Bayesian and causal inference, whether it is for my PhD or for other projects.

In a previous life, I have also been a journalist and the publication manager for the french online media [Le Média](https://lemediatv.fr>).

Current projects
================

Dynamics of a research program in high-energy physics (PhD, IZWT, Wuppertal)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Supersymmetry has been the subject of a significant amount of research efforts over the past fifty years, involving thousands of physicists. However, trust in supersymmetric models is now being challenged due to the lack of experimental confirmation. During my PhD, I propose to study this research program in order to understand in what sense supersymmetry research can be deemed rational. Can post-empiricist models of scientific rationality from philosophy of science provide a basis for pursuing certain theories under little experimental guidance? Or, should the pursuit of supersymmetry be explained in rational terms from a more utilitarian perspective, as part of a strategy of incremental theoretical change for efficiently maximising scientific output under certain constraints? Was supersymmetry research, instead, undertaken for sociological reasons, like it has been claimed by certain actors, and does the rational pursuit of the actors' self-interests necessarily hinder the rationality of the research process?

In order to address these questions, I apply quantitative methods (statistical modeling) to large amounts of citation and semantic data from the physics literature, as well as data about the social dimension of research (affiliations, social networks, etc.). My goal is to unveil the dynamics of the different kinds of research conducted around supersymmetry, but also to make causal claims about the processes that drive the commitment of the physicists into certain topics at certain moments in time. This should contribute to understand the strategies developed by scientists in order to maximize different kinds of payoffs, and therefore to our understanding of scientific rationality.

This project is highly interdiscplinary as it draws from various fields ("HPS", the sociology of scientific knowledge, formal social epistemology, models of scientific rationality...). It also draws from Historical Institutionalism, through an analogy between formal institutions and "research traditions".

  
Language Acquisition Across Cultures
------------------------------------

I am also collaborating with the <a href="https://lscp.dec.ens.fr/en">LSCP</a>, as part of the Language Acquisition Across Cultures team led by Alejandrina Cristia. This team studies Language Acquisition by collecting and analyzing long-form recordings capturing the sound environment of infants (what they ear) and their own vocal production.
This method generates large amounts of audio (typically thousands of hours of audio per corpus) which can be challenging to analyze. My work consists into the elaboration of statistical models and in the development of <a href="https://github.com/LAAC-LSCP/ChildProject">tools</a> that enable performant systematic analyses across many corpora. This is a fascinating topic, which I find stimulating both for conceptual reasons (for instance, it is tied with social anthropology) and technical reasons (it generates challenging problems involving statistical inference).

Energy transition
-----------------

I have also started working on various pet projects about electric power systems and the energy transition.
I have started designing a device for minimising the carbon footprint of the charge of electric batteries My progress is documented <a href="/battery-charge">here</a>. For this project I use various components including an Arduino, combined with some modelling of the power system in order to forecast the optimal charge program for reducing carbon emissions.

For another project, my goal is to model electricity production and consumption in order to assess the resiliency of different scenarios, using various optimization and statistical modelling techniques.
The project can be found [on my GitHub](https://github.com/lucasgautheron/scenarios-rte-simulation).
