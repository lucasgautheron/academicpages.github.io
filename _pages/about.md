Research interests
==================

I am a French student starting a PhD in in History and Philosophy of physics (IZWT, University of Wuppertal), with a training in HPS (Université de Paris) and in Physics (École Normale Supérieure de Cachan and Université Pierre et Marie Curie).
I am interested in epistemology, history and sociology of science, cultural evolution, innovation, and of course physics (cosmology, particle physics, gravitational astronomy and more). I also enjoy programming (mostly in python for the past few years) and statistics. In a previous life, I have also been a journalist and the publication manager for the french online media [Le Média](https://lemediatv.fr>).

Current projects
================

Dynamics of a research program in high-energy physics (PhD, IZWT, Wuppertal)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Supersymmetry has been the subject of a significant amount of research efforts over the past fifty years, involving thousands of physicists. However, the theory is now being challenged due to the lack of experimental confirmation. During my PhD, I propose to study this controversial research program in order to understand in what sense supersymmetry research can be deemed rational. Can post-empiricist models of scientific rationality from philosophy of science provide a basis for pursuing certain theories under little experimental guidance? Or, should the pursuit of supersymmetry be explained in rational terms from a more utilitarian perspective, as part of a strategy of incremental theoretical change for efficiently maximising scientific output under certain constraints? Was supersymmetry research, instead, undertaken for sociological reasons, like it has been claimed by certain actors, and do these actors' rational pursuit of their self-interests necessarily hinder the rationality of the research process? My goal is to address these questions.

For that, I will the literature and social networks of scientists by using quantitative methods such as NLP, network science, statistical modeling, in order to unveil the dynamics of the research conducted around supersymmetry, and for making causal inference about the processes that drive the commitment of the physicists into certaint topics.

This project is highly interdiscplinary as it draws from various fields (history, philosophy and sociology of science, in particular, the sociology of scientific knowledge, social epistemology, models of scientific rationality...). It also draws from Historical Institutionalism, through an analogy between formal institutions and "research traditions".

  
Language Acquisition Across Cultures
------------------------------------

I was until recently an engineer at the <a href="https://lscp.dec.ens.fr/en">LSCP</a>, as part of the Language Acquisition Across Cultures team led by Alejandrina Cristia. This team studies Language Acquisition by collecting and analyzing long-form recordings capturing the sound environment of infants (what they ear) and their own vocal production.
This method generates large amounts of audio (typically thousands of hours of audio per corpus) which can be challenging to analyze.
My work consisted into developing <a href="https://github.com/LAAC-LSCP/ChildProject">tools</a> that enable performant systematic analyses across such corpora. I am still trying to keep up with this project when I can find the time. This is a fascinating topic, which I find stimulating both for conceptual reasons (for instance, it is tied with social anthropology) and technical reasons (it generates challenging problems involving statistical inference).
