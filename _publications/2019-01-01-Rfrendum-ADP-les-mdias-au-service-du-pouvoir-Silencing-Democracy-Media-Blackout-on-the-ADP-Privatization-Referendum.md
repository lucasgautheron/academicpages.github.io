abstract: "In this article, I analyzed how signatures on a nationwide constitutional petition correlated with various socioeconomic/political variables in French cities. Low education turned out to be a strongly negative factor. I explored the possibility that this could be the result of poor media coverage. I then measured media coverage of the petition by applying a speech-to-text model to public television news archives. The article has been cited in a book, in research papers, and in an appeal to the French Constitutional Court to increase media coverage of these petitions."
